3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Having lived in this parish all my life I have been repeatedly
asked by my friends to write a short account of my early
recollections of Tottenham.</p>
<p>I feel a little diffident at doing so, and this being my first
attempt at committing my recollections to paper I trust my
readers will pardon any mistakes and omissions, and that it will
be as interesting to some of them to read as it has been to me to
write.</p>
<p>My father was born at Palmers Green in 1798; my mother was
born in this parish in the year 1800.&nbsp; They were married at
All Hallows Church in 1825, and continued to reside in Tottenham;
my father died in the year 1866, and my mother at the ripe old
age of 94, in the year 1894.</p>
<p>I can now see in my mind&rsquo;s eye the dear old village as
it was in my childhood, surrounded by meadows, cornfields, and
pretty country lanes and a great number of stately elm and other
trees.&nbsp; It hardly seems possible that the population was
then so small that all the inhabitants were known to one another,
and the appearance of strangers was at once a matter of
speculation as to who they were.</p>
<p>HARRIET COUCHMAN,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">WIDOW
OF</span><br />
<span class="smcap">John William Couchman</span>,<br />
Civil Engineer,<br />
16, Pembury Road,<br />
Tottenham,<br />
1909.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span><span
class="smcap">Tottenham</span>,</h2>
<p>75 years ago, was a very pretty quiet village, most of the
houses were good and old-fashioned; there were several mansions,
but very few shops.&nbsp; It was a favourite resort for Royalty,
and has always been considered a very healthy
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Some of the inhabitants lived to a very
advanced age.</p>
<p>The highway was measured in 1611; it was two miles and a
quarter long.&nbsp; Mile stones were then erected.</p>
<p>The parish was divided into different Manors, called
Pembrokes, Bruces, Daubeneys, Mockings, and Dovecotes or
Ducketts.</p>
<p>Tottenham Manor was sold at auction, 10th April, 1805.&nbsp;
Sir William Curtis, Baronet, purchased it for
&pound;11,000.&nbsp; There were then 38 copyhold tenants.&nbsp; A
Court Leet was held every year at the Old Plough Inn, High-road,
and anyone wishing to be admitted attended there for that
purpose.&nbsp; This was discontinued about the year 1860, as
there was not sufficient homage to summon.&nbsp; All business
since then has been transacted at the office of the Steward of
the Manor.</p>
<p>I remember hearing my father say one of the homage (a very old
gentleman, Mr. Philip Hunt), was late for the dinner.&nbsp; He
explained he had nearly reached his destination when he thought
his poor horse looked tired, so he took him home and afterwards
walked there.</p>
<p>There was a considerable amount of waste land at that time,
and the turf was <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>sold at 5s. per hundred, 2s. 6d. for the order, and 2s.
6d. for cutting&mdash;10s. per hundred.&nbsp; This has been
discontinued for a great many years.</p>
<h2>STAMFORD HILL.</h2>
<p>I purpose commencing here, where the Old Turnpike House and
Gate stood, by the pond called &ldquo;Craven&rsquo;s Pond&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Leg of Mutton Pond,&rdquo; because of its shape, on
which there used to be several beautiful swans.&nbsp; It was a
great source of delight to the young people, when frozen over, by
affording an opportunity for skating and sliding to many.</p>
<p>A large house stood on the estate called &ldquo;Craven
Lodge,&rdquo; where the owner, Mr. Arthur Craven, resided.&nbsp;
It was afterwards occupied by Mr. Samuel Morley.&nbsp; Perhaps it
may be interesting to mention that Garibaldi came to Tottenham,
at his invitation, and delivered an address on the
&ldquo;Grievances of Italy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were two small houses on the top of the hill, one of
which was used as a Post Office; then came the old-fashioned
Turnpike Inn, which has been pulled down and another built on the
site.&nbsp; The two small old shops are still in existence, but
the large house belonging to, and in occupation of, Mr. Edward
Sievieking, is no longer there, the land being now all built
over.</p>
<h2>BAILEY&rsquo;S LANE.</h2>
<p>There were a few old cottages beyond Mr. Sievieking&rsquo;s
garden, and on the opposite side of the road Sumpter&rsquo;s
livery stables; then fields on both sides down to <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the River Lea,
where there were coke ovens always brightly burning.&nbsp; There
were several large houses lying back from the High-road, Stamford
Hill, with front gardens on the waste land; of these only two
remain.</p>
<p>There was a mansion standing next, where Mr. Fowler Newsam
resided for many years.&nbsp; There was a very pretty walk round
the shrubbery and garden, the estate containing altogether about
eight acres of land; the grounds were enclosed in cleft oak park
palings, with lodge at entrance.&nbsp; There was a mounting stone
on the gravel path outside, and it is not many years ago that it
was taken away.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Newsam were most kind and generous, and their
great delight in life was in doing good and giving pleasure to
others.&nbsp; I always remember their enjoyable hay-making
parties; one can now hardly understand the quiet spot it was
then.&nbsp; Their death was a very great loss to the parish.</p>
<p>When the turnpike was removed from the top of the Hill, a toll
bar was placed across the road at the corner of this estate, but
was not there long; it was taken away when all turnpikes were
done away with.</p>
<p>Stamford Hill was crossed by a bridge called &ldquo;Stone
Bridge,&rdquo; which was about 26 feet high from the crown of the
road to the top of the parapet.&nbsp; Now the South Tottenham
railway crosses the road there.</p>
<p>The next estate was called &ldquo;Mark Field,&rdquo; and was
fifty-four acres in extent; there was a large house lying some
distance back, <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>in its own grounds, belonging to and in the occupation of
Mr. William Robson.</p>
<p>The other large house at the corner of Page Green belonged to
and was in the occupation of the Rev. George Hodgson Thompson,
the first minister at Trinity Church, Tottenham Green, and had
over twelve acres of land adjoining the last-mentioned.</p>
<p>The estates were bordered by a broad piece of waste land, a
ditch, and low quick set hedge; and there were large heaps of
flint stones at the roadside for repair of the roads.&nbsp; At
that time the path on Stamford Hill was a gravel one, and had not
even a curb stone.</p>
<p>When Mr. Munt lived at the corner house he kindly lent his
grounds to the Rev. George Brewster Twining, who was the Vicar of
Holy Trinity Church, for the Sunday School treat to be held
there.&nbsp; Several caravans of Bohemian gipsies passing along
the High-road; the men, seeing the children playing games,
stopped their horses, and threw their children over the low quick
set hedge; they were very clean and prettily dressed in red,
white, and blue, and were highly delighted to mix with our Sunday
School children.&nbsp; We gave them some cake, and persuaded them
to return to their friends, which they did, although
unwillingly.&nbsp; They were a very superior kind of gipsy, and
evidently the precursors of the German gipsies, who have since
been such an annoyance to the country.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>PAGE
GREEN&mdash;BRAMBLE LANE<br />
(Now BROAD LANE).</h2>
<p>There was a side road leading to the Rev. G. H.
Thompson&rsquo;s house, with post and chain fence down the
left-hand side a considerable distance, and fir and other trees;
this road also led to the house belonging to and occupied by Mr.
James Rowe, which had upwards of thirty-one acres of land
attached to it.&nbsp; A large pond, called Page Green Pond, was
on the green opposite the house.</p>
<p>At the end of the green, and facing the High-road, a large
house stood, occupied by Mr. Spartelle, whose grounds extended
some distance down the lane.&nbsp; The Earlsmead Board School is
now built on this site.</p>
<p>At the top of Page Green, on the east side of the High-road,
there stood a remarkably handsome clump of seven trees, planted
in a circular form, and called the Seven Sisters.&nbsp; In the
middle there stood a walnut tree, which it is said never
increased in size, though it continued annually to bear
leaves.&nbsp; The prevailing opinion in Bedwell&rsquo;s time (the
Rev. William Bedwell was Vicar of Tottenham from 1607 to 1632)
was that someone had suffered martyrdom on this spot, but of this
there is no authentic account, nor is there anything satisfactory
as to the original planting of these trees to be met with, but it
appears they were at their full growth in Bedwell&rsquo;s time,
and may be considered to be in 1818 upwards of 300 years
old.&nbsp; The walnut tree was not cut down <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>for a good
many years after the others.&nbsp; I remember my father having it
done, and then the seven daughters of Mr. MacRae planted seven
other trees in the middle of the green; they are now living, one
is a sapling.&nbsp; A few years ago Mr. Hibbert&rsquo;s seven
daughters planted seven other trees at the end by the
High-road.</p>
<p>On the north side of Page Green there was a white house, with
verandah and creepers all over, in the occupation of Mr.
Rowcroft; it had a very large hall.&nbsp; At that time many of
the good old houses had large halls, almost like rooms.&nbsp; The
grounds were very pretty, extending at the back of Grove
Place-gardens as far as the Bull Inn.&nbsp; About the centre of
the beautiful garden there was a high mound, and grotto,
overlooking a lovely lake.&nbsp; Many were the invitations I
received to play in that garden when I was a little child, but my
mother never allowed me to go; she had an idea I should run up
the mound and fall into the lake.&nbsp; I was very pleased when
she at last consented.&nbsp; There was a shady walk, planted with
trees, all round the meadow; it was about here that years ago
there was a hermit&rsquo;s cell and the Chapel of St. Anne.</p>
<p>Next to this house there were two semi-detached white-fronted
houses (one of which was occupied by Miss Coare, one of the
Society of Friends), then a stretch of fields on both sides to
the end of the lane.</p>
<p>Returning to the High-road; at the corner stood a large, white
house, and garden, adjoining the row of houses called
Grove-place, which were built at the beginning of last <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>century.&nbsp; Next to the Bull Inn, which is one of the
old inns of Tottenham, were the cottages called Bull Row, one of
which was a toy shop, kept by Mrs. Travell, and another a cake
and sweet shop, kept by Mrs. Oakman; there were so few shops then
that these two small places were well patronised.</p>
<h2>TOTTENHAM GREEN.</h2>
<p>In the second of the two houses on the south side, the Rev. G.
B. Twining lived when he first came to Tottenham.&nbsp; The next
estate belonged to the Rev. Richard Momford Wood; it consisted of
22 acres of meadow land, rented by Mr. Thomas King; the fields
reached to the Hale.&nbsp; It was afterwards rented by Mr.
Goddard&rsquo;s father, who lived at the High Gross, on the
opposite side to where they now live.&nbsp; He kept a quantity of
geese, and every morning, at 10 o&rsquo;clock, they left the yard
and went to the fields; all alone they crossed the road, walking
two by two, like school children.&nbsp; At 4 o&rsquo;clock they
returned in the same manner; and never met with any mishap.&nbsp;
One can judge by this the amount of traffic there was in the
High-road at that time.</p>
<p>This is now called Springfield Estate.&nbsp; The large house
occupied by Mr. Rickman was taken down, and the Tottenham
Hospital erected.&nbsp; The three houses adjoining are still
there.</p>
<p>In the year 1798 my grandfather, Mr. Thomas Sanders, purchased
the next estate.&nbsp; There was a detached house with good
garden, and a great many coach-houses and stables, built in the
time the stage coaches <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>were on the road, a beautiful meadow,
and a large orchard, stocked with choicest fruit trees.</p>
<p>Dr. Robinson, in his History of Tottenham, speaks of &ldquo;A
singular duel&rdquo; that took place in this field.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That upon Thursday, the 8th November, 1610, there was a
meeting of the neighbours to warme Mr. John Syms, his house, the
signe of the Swanne, at High Cross, among whom came John Nelhamte
and John Whiston, whoe, having some grudge or quarrel between
them, diner being done they two did use some private speches
within themselves.&nbsp; Taking leave of the company, went to
their houses, either of them taking his pick-stafe in their
hands, mett in a field behind Mr. Edward Barkham&rsquo;s house,
commonly caull&rsquo;d or knowne by the name of
Baldwin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Theare they two fought till John Nelham
receyed a wound by John Whiston in his throate, fell down dead,
and never spake word after.&nbsp; So the Coroner, upon the
Saturdaie next, sate upon him; was buried the same daie, being
the 10th of November, 1610.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the death of my grandmother we lived in this house, and
I well remember one evening in winter a mad bull rushing down the
private roadway, crowds of people following it.&nbsp; After what
seemed a very long time someone fetched a gun and shot it.&nbsp;
It caused a very great commotion for the time, and we felt very
thankful when it was all over.&nbsp; Wonderful to relate, no one
was hurt.</p>
<p>At the death of my mother the house and land at the rear was
sold to Mr. William Hawley, who formed Colsterworth-road and <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>built houses
and flats to accommodate about 200 families.</p>
<p>The next large house, with garden in front, was occupied by
the father of the Rev. G. H. Thompson, and afterwards by various
tenants, the last of whom was Mr. Marsden.&nbsp; After he vacated
it was unlet for a long while, and during that time my dear
husband used a room for a work room, in which he made a model of
a design for Westminster Bridge.&nbsp; It was very beautiful, all
in small pieces of brass.&nbsp; When finished he had a glass case
made, and presented it to Mr. Hawksley, civil engineer, Great
George-street, Westminster, who was a great friend of his, and
for whom he went to the Island of Barbadoes, West Indies, as
there was a great scarcity of water, and stayed until he found a
sufficient supply, to the entire satisfaction of Mr. Hawksley and
the inhabitants of Barbadoes.&nbsp; He also made a model of the
&ldquo;Streets of London,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Floating
Battery,&rdquo; both of which he presented to the Royal United
Service Institution, Whitehall-yard, and they were afterwards
removed to South Kensington Museum.&nbsp; These models are well
worth seeing.</p>
<p>The Congregational Chapel was erected on this site about the
year 1867.</p>
<p>At the back of this Chapel there was, and still is, a very old
house with gabled roof, originally the &ldquo;Old Ship
Inn,&rdquo; a very noted place when the stage coaches were on the
road.&nbsp; It was afterwards used as a Boys&rsquo; School, kept
by Mr. James Holmes, <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and called Tottenham Green
Academy.&nbsp; It was the property of Mr. Benjamin Godfrey
Windus, who left it to his daughter, the wife of the Rev. Peter
De Putron.&nbsp; Then came three houses, which lay back, with a
long piece of waste land in front, planted with a row of trees,
which gave them a very pretty appearance.&nbsp; One of these
houses had a very large cupboard, like a small room, in the back
bedroom, which was built into the next house, where Dr.
Babbington&rsquo;s sister lived, and here there was a very
beautiful ceiling.&nbsp; This house is still there, but in
ruins.</p>
<h2>HIGH CROSS.</h2>
<p>The shops here are about the same, only modernised, and
lowered.&nbsp; There used to be a butcher&rsquo;s, baker&rsquo;s,
stationer&rsquo;s (which was then the post office),
poulterer&rsquo;s, carpenter&rsquo;s, tailor&rsquo;s, Rose and
Crown Inn, chandler&rsquo;s shop, hairdresser&rsquo;s,
fruiterer&rsquo;s, and grocer&rsquo;s, at the corner.&nbsp; The
post office was afterwards on the Green, and then removed to the
stationer&rsquo;s, where it is now.</p>
<p>High Cross-lane, now called High Cross-road, was a very
different place to what it is now.&nbsp; As the word lane
indicates, it was a very quiet place.&nbsp; On the south side
there were a good many old cottages, looking more in keeping with
their surroundings then they do at the present day.&nbsp; Then
came two detached houses, followed by fields till one came to the
old cottages at the commencement of The Hale.&nbsp; On the north
side, near the High-road, there were stables, and out-buildings
jutting out, which made the roadway just there very narrow.&nbsp;
From <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>these
sheds there was a continuation of fields almost to the end of the
lane.</p>
<h2>THE HALE.</h2>
<p>Here, on one side, stood some very old cottages, with long
gardens in front, and the White Hart Inn.&nbsp; On the other side
was the Pound, standing on the waste land opposite &ldquo;The
White Cottage,&rdquo; and next came the old farmhouse, and land,
in the occupation of Mr. Willan, the proprietor of the West End
omnibus.&nbsp; This was afterwards Ware&rsquo;s Nursery Grounds
(he was son-in-law to Mr. Willan).&nbsp; It is now covered with
factories.&nbsp; Then there were fields down to the River
Lea.</p>
<h2>GREAT EASTERN RAILWAY.</h2>
<p>This main Eastern Counties lines was the first railway in
Tottenham.&nbsp; Soon after it was opened there was a bad
accident at the Hale Station; we had no hospital then, so the
injured passengers were taken in by various residents.&nbsp; The
railway carriages were none too comfortable, the third-class
being all open.&nbsp; This was a very busy station, so much
cattle coming here for the London market.</p>
<h2>THE RIVER LEA.</h2>
<p>It was a beautiful walk along its banks, with forget-me-nots
growing by the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; The numerous boats and
barges gave it a very animated appearance.</p>
<h2>LEA BRIDGE.</h2>
<p>In a field here quantities of wild orchids grew.&nbsp; The
river was frozen one very severe winter; I remember walking
across it.</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>TOTTENHAM MILLS.</h2>
<p>These mills stood one on either side of the road leading to
Walthamstow, by Tottenham Lock.&nbsp; They were formerly paper
mills, and there seems to have been a good deal of bad fortune
attached to them; they were burnt down 23rd February, 1778;
rebuilt in a very substantial manner, and sold September 25th,
1779, when they were started as corn and oil mills.&nbsp; In
January, 1816, they were so much damaged by a flood that they
were not completely at work for nearly the whole of the following
year.</p>
<p>I often accompanied my father on horseback.&nbsp; The road to
the Forest was a favourite one with him, and, although I, too,
enjoyed it, having to pass these mills rather took the edge off
my pleasure, the noise was so deafening.&nbsp; I never could lose
the fear that the horses would be frightened; I always felt
thankful when we were safely past.&nbsp; There was another very
large fire about the year 1860, and the mills have not been
rebuilt.</p>
<p>The turnpike house and toll bar was near that spot.&nbsp; The
charge was 6d. for a carriage, 1d. for a single horse, 3d. for a
chaise, 4d. for a taxed cart, 1s. for a waggon with 4 horses,
with 5 horses 1s. 6d., and for more than 5 horses 2s., and
&frac12;d. for each foot passenger not a resident in
Tottenham.&nbsp; A few hundred yards further on by the Ferry Boat
Inn there was another turnpike, and the same charges were made
there.</p>
<h2><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>THE
MARSHES.</h2>
<p>There are about 298 acres of marsh land.&nbsp; The several
names are &ldquo;Lock Mead Marsh,&rdquo; &ldquo;Clendish
Hills,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mill Mead,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mitchley,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Broad Mead,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wild Marsh.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
latter is the largest.&nbsp; Beautiful cowslips used to grow
here.&nbsp; To cross from one marsh to the other there was a
ferry boat at Page&rsquo;s Lock, and another at Higham Hill,
where passengers were punted over at a charge of 1d. each
person.</p>
<p>The names of the common fields are &ldquo;Down Field&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Hale Field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above were closed on the 5th April, and open on the 12th
August for grazing of horses and cows belonging to the resident
parishioners in Tottenham.&nbsp; Before the cattle went on they
were all branded by the Pound Keeper.&nbsp; The marshes belonged
to a great many different owners, who had small wooden land marks
with their initials on each.&nbsp; In the case of the New River
Co. their&rsquo;s were iron.&nbsp; Some left their grass and made
hay; others did not seem to care for it.</p>
<p>All the marshes on the East side of the River Lea have been
sold to the East London Water Works, and those on the West to the
Urban District Council.</p>
<p>The Rifle Butts were built about the year 1860, and have been
twice burnt down.&nbsp; Mr. Delano, who lived at Asplin&rsquo;s
Farm close by, built himself a nice cottage with garden all <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>round on his
land on the Marshes for his own use and called it &ldquo;Butts
Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This side of the Lea is not so very much altered.&nbsp; The
old Blue House was pulled down, and a new one erected where Mr.
Page&rsquo;s son lived and managed the locks.&nbsp; There was a
beautiful wild garden on the right hand side, made by Mr.
Page&rsquo;s father, just beyond the boat yard, and had taken a
very great number of years to cultivate.&nbsp; There was a
quantity of high trees, and all sorts of wild flowers, and it
ended with a stile on to the banks of the Lea.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, during a very heavy succession of storms, some few
years ago, this was all swept away.&nbsp; The forget-me-nots were
especially beautiful large flowers; it seemed very sad they
should be swept away after all the trouble and expense
incurred.</p>
<h2>TOTTENHAM HIGH CROSS.</h2>
<p>In 1809 a subscription was raised to repair the Cross, which
was then in a very dilapidated state.&nbsp; The shape was not in
any way altered, but it was covered with cement, and at the same
time various architectural embellishment were introduced.&nbsp;
On each face of the octagon is a shield containing one of the
letters composing the word Totenham in the old characters.&nbsp;
The Cross was then surrounded with a curb and iron railings,
which were removed a good many years ago.</p>
<p>At the back of the Cross there were the three shops still
standing, a stationer&rsquo;s, draper&rsquo;s, and
butcher&rsquo;s; by the side there was a green planted with
beautiful elm trees, <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>only three of which remain now.&nbsp;
At the back of this stood two pretty old houses, in occupation of
Mr. Thomas Corney and Rev. James Baird.&nbsp; This was originally
one house and was occupied by Dean Wood, who about the year 1600
had the present cross erected, which in 1809 was repaired and
altered to its present appearance.</p>
<p>Next to Mr. Baird&rsquo;s there was a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop,
where the old skeleton horse stood over the gateway.&nbsp; This
horse belonged to Mr. Charles Tuck, who kept the butcher&rsquo;s
shop at the corner, which is now a chemists, and was such a
willing animal that one day it fell down dead, drawing a load
which was too much for him.&nbsp; I remember him well, and used
often to feed him with bread.</p>
<h2>FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL.</h2>
<p>This was originally up to the year 1877 a Free Grammar School
endowed by Sarah, Dowager Duchess of Somerset, who in 1686
bequeathed the sum of &pound;250 for the enlargement of the
school house, and a further sum of &pound;1,100 for the purpose
of extending its benefit to all children of such inhabitants of
the parish of Tottenham as were not possessed of an estate,
either freehold or copyhold, of the annual value of
&pound;20.</p>
<p>The Savings Bank used to be held here every Monday evening,
and was kept by Mr. Peter Rickards, the school master and clerk
to Trinity Church.&nbsp; It was afterwards removed to the Post
Office, where it now is, at the corner of High Cross-road.</p>
<h2><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>REYNARDSON&rsquo;S ALMSHOUSES.</h2>
<p>In 1685 Nicholas Reynardson, Esq., by his will, dated April
2nd, 1685, and by a codicil dated February 20th, 1688, bequeathed
the sum of &pound;2,000, with part of which he directed that an
almshouse should be built for six poor aged men and six poor aged
women, with a chapel; and that the residue should be laid out in
lands, and for the endowment and repairs of such almshouses, and
for the payment of &pound;4 to each pensioner annually by
quarterly payments, besides a gown of black frieze of 20s. value
once in two years, and &pound;20 a year to the reader for reading
prayers once every forenoon, and for teaching twenty poor
children to read and write, inhabitants of the parish of
Tottenham whose parents were not able to pay for the same.&nbsp;
Mr. Reynardson also directed that the said salary of &pound;20
per annum should be allowed out of the lands to be purchased to
the reader of prayers and teacher of such children, and a black
gown of 20s. value every year at Christmas for ever.&nbsp; The
residue of the rents to be distributed amongst the poor, except
30s. allowed for a dinner on the 1st August every year at a
meeting of the Trustees, including the minister and
churchwardens, and the surplus and residue of the estates to be
distributed among the poor.</p>
<p>Where the police Station now stands there originally was a
large house enclosed in a high brick wall, and was built in 1776
by Will Latimer, of Warwick.&nbsp; It had a flight <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>of stone
steps to the front door, and a window in the hall on each side of
the door.&nbsp; The occupier was the Rev. Thomas Powell,
afterwards called &ldquo;Miser Powell.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was going
to be married, and on the morning of the day of the wedding was
to take place he received a message from the lady, saying she had
altered her mind.&nbsp; From then until his death he never let a
woman enter his house, and never went out, excepting now and then
when he preached at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.&nbsp; He had a
large garden with bathroom and swimming bath in the middle of the
lawn, all beautifully tiled; at the back there was a fish pond
and meadow.&nbsp; The last time I saw him he was looking over the
high brick wall with a blanket over his shoulders.&nbsp; He used
to give dinner parties to his gentlemen friends; everything
prepared and sent down with waiters from London.</p>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Powell was a very clever author and artist,
and had commenced drawing figures of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John on the staircase.&nbsp; It was his intention to have them
frescoed.&nbsp; I was told he left all his money and estate to
the London Hospital, but that only &pound;40,000 went to the
Hospital, the estate had to go to the heir at law, a gentleman
named &ldquo;Mieux,&rdquo; his sister&rsquo;s son, who afterwards
sold it to the British Land Company.</p>
<p>I think Mr. Powell must have been particularly fond of
violets, they grew in his garden in such profusion.</p>
<h2><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>THE
POUND ALMSHOUSES.</h2>
<p>There were originally only four almshouses, but in 1847, when
the Pound was removed to the waste land in The Hale, three old
inhabitants, Mr. Thomas Corney, Mr. William Janson, and Mr. John
Day, had three others erected at their own expense.</p>
<h2>STONELEYS SOUTH, NOW STONELEYS ROAD.</h2>
<p>The building which still stands at the corner of the road was
originally the Girls&rsquo; Green School, or School of Industry,
and was used for this purpose until 1862, when the present
buildings were erected in Somerset-road.&nbsp; The girls always
looked very nice in their uniform, which consisted of a green
dress, white tippet, apron and cap, and a coarse straw bonnet
trimmed with green.&nbsp; The school was supported by voluntary
contributions.&nbsp; Stoneley South, at the entrance, has not
altered much in appearance since I first remember it, but in
those days after passing the house and premises which stands
between Balthazar-street and Stoneleys-road, which was then
occupied by William Humphreys, carpenter and builder, there was
nothing but fields, with a public footpath across leading into
Down-lane.&nbsp; This was the only way of reaching The Hale,
unless one went by way of High Cross-lane.</p>
<h2>PLOUGH INN.</h2>
<p>The old Plough Inn was a long, low building, very quaint and
picturesque with gabled roof, lying back from the road, with
large <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>open
space in front, and cottages down one side.</p>
<p>The Court Leet for Tottenham was held here for a great number
of years.&nbsp; John Brooks, the landlord, was also one of the
Homage.&nbsp; The old inn, which was built in 1537, was taken
down in 1891 and another building erected by the side of the
roadway, which was then opened, and leads to the Marshes.</p>
<h2>BROOK STREET.</h2>
<p>The Plymouth Brethren Chapel was built at Mr. Robert
Howard&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; It has a burial ground on the
opposite side of the street.&nbsp; I never remember seeing more
than one tomb stone; it was to the memory of Jane Johnson, and
that has lately been taken away.</p>
<p>There was an old sweet stuff shop in front by the High-road,
the floor of which was below the level of the road.&nbsp;
Adjoining here is the block of houses and shops which are now
about being taken down to widen the road for the electric tramway
cars.&nbsp; On the site where Knight&rsquo;s, the pawnbrokers,
was built, at the corner of Waverley-road, stood the old George
and Vulture Inn.&nbsp; It had a very large room at the back, and
the Royal family used to come down to attend balls there.</p>
<h2>WAVERLEY ROAD.</h2>
<p>At the back, down the turning, there was a good sized house
and large garden, with <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>lake and bridge, in occupation of Mr.
Thos. Finney.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was the first built in
Tottenham.&nbsp; The lease had just expired in 1882, when it was
burned down.&nbsp; It stood back a little distance from the road,
with burial ground in front, reaching to the footpath in
High-road.</p>
<p>On this site Messrs. G. L. Wilson&rsquo;s premises were
built.&nbsp; This is the second time they have been built as
there was another very large fire in 1904.</p>
<h2>FACTORY LANE.</h2>
<p>In 1815 a mill for winding silk was built; this failed, and in
1820 it was opened as a lace factory.&nbsp; This also proved
unsuccessful, and in 1837 it was opened as an India rubber
factory, and was the means of providing work for hundreds of
people.</p>
<p>Some years ago half of this factory and Silk Mill-terrace was
sold at auction to the Licensed Victuallers&rsquo; Company.&nbsp;
This half has lately been taken down and Pembroke-terrace, as it
was afterwards called, converted into shops and Parr&rsquo;s
Bank.</p>
<h2>PEMBROKE HOUSE.</h2>
<p>A pretty white house, with verandah covered with creepers, and
large garden.&nbsp; The house stood back in its own grounds, and
was enclosed by a brick wall and a beautiful row of chesnut and
lime trees that were very much admired, as were also the sweet
voices of the birds who made their nests there.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>This
house has been pulled down and shops have been built on the
spot.&nbsp; A good many years ago there was a very sad
accident.&nbsp; A drove of bullocks was being driven past; one
got loose, pinned Mr. Glover, the coach builder, who lived
opposite, to the wall, and gored him to death.</p>
<p>Before we had the railway in The Hale many droves of cattle
were continually driven along the High-road to the London
markets.</p>
<p>Where Commerce-terrace now stands there were several houses,
one called the &ldquo;Ivy House,&rdquo; as it was covered with
ivy, occupied by Mr. Henry Hayes.&nbsp; It was enclosed in iron
railings with very beautiful iron gates, and had a large garden,
which extended all the way down to the end of Reform-row.</p>
<h2>SANCHEZ&rsquo;S ALMSHOUSES.</h2>
<p>These almshouses bearing his name, and consisting of eight
tenements, were built by him in the year 1596.&nbsp; Four were
for aged women widows, and four for aged men widowers.&nbsp; Each
pensioner had &pound;4 annually by quarterly payments, and there
was a biennial allowance of &pound;6 for the purchase of a gown
of black frieze of 20s. value from the owners of the Stoneleigh
Estate.&nbsp; The latter was discontinued years ago and money
given instead.&nbsp; There was also &pound;1 per annum recreation
money for the Committee.&nbsp; They are now closed, pending
rebuilding.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to talk to the inmates.&nbsp; One in
particular, a Mrs. Martin, loved to recall the days of her youth,
which had <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>been passed in a village near Hatfield.&nbsp; She
remembered when Napoleon Bonaparte was regarded as a kind of
ogre, and when naughty children were told &ldquo;Boney is
coming&rdquo; it reduced them to a state of abject terror.&nbsp;
One day a man was seen coming towards the village on a dandy
horse, when the cry was raised &ldquo;Boney has come at
last.&rdquo;&nbsp; The children fled in wild alarm to hide
themselves.&nbsp; She and her little brother crept under a
four-post bedstead, and it was a long time before her mother
could induce her to believe that there was no cause for fear, and
that she might emerge with safety, which after much persuasion
she did, but her brother refused to leave his hiding place for
the whole of that day.&nbsp; When she was a little older she was
put to school by a lady, and in return she had to do her
needlework, most of the school time being taken up in this
way.&nbsp; Before sewing machines were invented a woman&rsquo;s
time was fully occupied in doing the needlework for her
family.&nbsp; Ready-made articles were unknown.&nbsp; Girls were
taught to be very thorough in their work, and if they wished for
embroidery they had to make it themselves.</p>
<h2>QUAKERS&rsquo; MEETING HOUSE</h2>
<p>or Society of Friends is adjoining.&nbsp; It was erected in
1744, and enlarged about the year 1775, and fitted with seats for
about 400 persons.&nbsp; Considerable additions were made in
1832.&nbsp; There is also a burial ground <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>attached to
it, which was added in 1803, and was closed some years back.</p>
<p>The deceased were interred in rows without any distinction,
and a plan kept which identified the spot where the departed
friend was interred.&nbsp; There are neither grave stones nor any
other monuments to mark the spot where any one lies.</p>
<p>At one time there was a number of this sect in
Tottenham&mdash;a very admirable class of people, thoroughly just
and genuine.&nbsp; Their dress was rather quaint, but worthy of
great admiration; neatness, goodness, and simplicity form the
three features of it.&nbsp; The poke bonnet was perfect, with the
sweet little goffered frill round, in nearly all cases, a nice
face, so suitable to the wearer; then generally a dove or
mouse-coloured silk gown, neatly made and very ample in the
skirt, just to escape the ground.&nbsp; It would have been a
great fault to have a speck of dirt on them of any kind.&nbsp;
They were scrupulously clean and on no account did they like or
allow their ankles to be seen.</p>
<p>A friend of mine knew two old lady Quakers who many years ago
kept, for amusement, a small private school of twelve or fourteen
children; she herself was one of the pupils for eight or ten
years, and admired them exceedingly with their pretty white caps
drawn tightly with cords, but at the same time thought them a
little sharp.&nbsp; Of course in those days each child had
individual attention, and she remembers perfectly well, when
being taught to write, the old lady with ruler in her hand, the
pupil <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>seated at the table; if the pen was not held properly,
down came the ruler thump across the knuckles without any
warning.</p>
<p>Another little incident.&nbsp; They were very keen on sampler
work, and if one did not put the needle into the canvas quite
right, the first thing cue felt was the needle run into
one&rsquo;s fingers.</p>
<p>The child of to-day would not appreciate that kind of
treatment; nor did they then.</p>
<p>This same friend also told me of a Quaker who had a very large
grocer&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; He was often asked for a little piece
of string by the country women, and I suppose he got rather tired
of giving it, so on one occasion he said in his quiet way,
&ldquo;Take what thy conscience will allow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
woman said it would allow her to take it all.</p>
<p>They always looked well after their pounds, shillings, and
pence, and very often amassed large fortunes; it is rare to hear
of a really poor Quaker.&nbsp; In this respect they are very good
to one another and talk little about it.</p>
<p>I must not forget to mention the men&rsquo;s attire; it was
then as quaint as the women&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They were always
dressed in brown or drab cutaway coats, without any collar to
them; low hats with a brim nearly as wide as the depth of the
hat; and very often knee breeches.&nbsp; Many allowed their hair
to grow very long.</p>
<p>Then the service in their meeting house, as their place of
worship was called, is rather strange.&nbsp; They all sit
perfectly quiet, until the spirit moves them, and then, be it man
or woman, stand up and expound.</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Next to
the Friends&rsquo; Meeting House there used to be an
apothecary&rsquo;s shop, kept by a Mr. Silver.&nbsp; It was a
one-storey building.&nbsp; The shop had two rounded windows close
together, the door being at the side.&nbsp; In each window stood
a row of coloured bottles, but for many years no business was
transacted here.&nbsp; By the terms of Mr. Silver&rsquo;s will
the shop was to be left for a certain number of years as it was
on the day of his death.&nbsp; During this time Mr. Thomas
Shillitoe, one of the Society of Friends, opened a
chemist&rsquo;s shop next door.&nbsp; He had what I considered a
very objectionable habit.&nbsp; When pouring out medicine he
always licked the last drop from the bottle.</p>
<h2>SCOTLAND GREEN.</h2>
<p>In front there is what was formerly known as the Blue School,
where the girls were educated free.&nbsp; It is now the Middle
Class School.&nbsp; Upon a portion of the site stood the Watch
House, prisoner&rsquo;s cage, and John Fowler&rsquo;s house, who
was the Parish Beadle.&nbsp; This was quite sufficient at that
time, and in case of more help being required, a constable was
sent for to London.&nbsp; Then the Police Station at the High
Cross was built, and the whole of the site taken for the Middle
Class School.</p>
<p>A great many of the old cottages are now standing on Scotland
Green.&nbsp; They used to have strange names to identify them
then, such as &ldquo;Ward&rsquo;s Alley,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tubby&rsquo;s Alley,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stack Yard,&rdquo;
etc., by which names they are still known.&nbsp; The Moselle
crosses the road there from High-road and empties itself into the
Carbuncle Ditch.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>There
used to be an old-fashioned house and large pleasure and kitchen
garden, occupied by Mrs. John Holt.&nbsp; This was taken down and
two good houses built, both occupied by doctors, viz., Dr. Watson
and Dr. Jackson, who were the first tenants.</p>
<p>The adjoining detached house, now called &ldquo;Rheola,&rdquo;
was occupied by Miss Mary Stacey for a very great many
years.&nbsp; She was a very philanthropic lady, and one of the
Society of Friends.&nbsp; She would often have gentlemen who were
to give addresses at the meeting at her house, and would
entertain them.&nbsp; Once one called whom she did not know, but
believing him to be what he represented himself, she invited him
to take tea and spend the night, but the next morning he was
missing, and so was her handsome silver tea pot which had been
used the evening before.</p>
<p>The next house was called the &ldquo;White House,&rdquo; and
for many years was occupied by Mrs. Martha Horne, also one of the
Society of Friends.&nbsp; A small white house adjoining, occupied
by Mr. Linzell, and the old Red Lion Inn, which extended over the
land which now forms the entrance to Lansdowne-road, were pulled
down and the present Red Lion built and Lansdowne-road formed in
or about the year 1870.&nbsp; I do not see much difference till
we come to the Bell Brewery.&nbsp; On this side stood a pretty
one-storey detached cottage, where Mr. Haddon&rsquo;s clerk
lived.&nbsp; This was taken down and the bottling stores
erected.</p>
<p>There was a large shop next, kept by Mr. Johnson, tallow
chandler&mdash;a shop much <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>patronized, as candles were our
principal illuminant.&nbsp; It was not till 1847 that the Gas
Company was formed.&nbsp; The window was very tastefully arranged
with different coloured wax candles of all sizes; very high ones
in the middle, graduating to quite small ones.&nbsp; The house
adjoining was at one time a school, afterwards a chemist&rsquo;s
shop, and is now in the occupation of Mr. Bately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie House&rdquo; was the property of, and occupied by
Miss Jemima Arabella Holt.&nbsp; She gave the ground on which St.
Paul&rsquo;s Church was built in 1858.&nbsp; For some years
previous to this services had been held in an iron building by
the Rev. Mr. Harrison.&nbsp; He once had bills printed announcing
he would preach three sermons on consecutive Sunday evenings, the
subjects being &ldquo;Thieves, Thieves,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fire,
Fire,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Are you Insured.&rdquo;&nbsp; On each
occasion the building was crowded.</p>
<h2>PARK LANE, FORMERLY MARSH LANE.</h2>
<p>Near the High-road was an old house called &ldquo;The
Beggars&rsquo; Lodging-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a great boon to
tramps, as they found accommodation here for a very small
sum.&nbsp; A large fire was always burning brightly in the winter
evenings.</p>
<p>The National School for Boys was built in 1841, and the Drill
Hall in 1864.&nbsp; Here the Vestries were held for some
years.&nbsp; There were two nurseries on the left hand side of
the lane, and then on both sides fields till one came to
Willoughby-lane.&nbsp; Here stood Willoughby House; there was not
much <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>architectural beauty about it; it was a one-storied,
straight-looking, white building, with three windows on either
side of the door, and seven on the floor above.&nbsp; There was
not much land attached to it, only a little over nine acres in
all.&nbsp; Mr. Henry Lewis Smale was the owner and the last
occupier.&nbsp; In the eighteenth century it belonged to Daniel
Booth, Esq., the Governor of the Bank of England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crow&rsquo;s Nest,&rdquo; a quaint old house, was
on the opposite side of the way, and next came Willoughby Farm,
the property of the Rector of St. Luke&rsquo;s, Old-street,
E.C.&nbsp; There was an old farmhouse and upwards of fifty-one
acres of land.</p>
<h2>COOMBES CROFT HOUSE,</h2>
<p>which in the eighteenth century was called &ldquo;Coney
Bee&rsquo;s Croft,&rdquo; was formerly the Workhouse, and quite
large enough for all requirements.&nbsp; The deeds relating to
the Parish lands were kept here, in a tin box, within an iron
repository.</p>
<h2>EDMONTON WORKHOUSE,</h2>
<p>which was built in 1841&ndash;2, is one of the largest in
England, and none too large for present requirements.&nbsp;
Coombes Croft was then used for several different purposes.&nbsp;
At one time it was a Home for Little Boys, and afterwards offices
for the Local Board of Health.&nbsp; This body was not organised
until 1850, when the meetings were held at the Free Grammar
School.</p>
<p>The private improvement rate was made when the main works for
the water supply and drainage were approaching completion.&nbsp;
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>This the
owner could either pay at once, and in that case was entitled to
a reduction, or it could extend over a period not exceeding
thirty years.&nbsp; All who were able to pay in one sum did
so.&nbsp; Mr. Heath was the first clerk.&nbsp; He served the
Board for nineteen years, and was succeeded in 1869 by Mr.
Crowne, who still holds the office of Clerk to the Tottenham
Urban District Council.&nbsp; When Mr. Crowne first came
Tottenham and Wood Green were one parish.&nbsp; In 1888 they were
separated, and Wood Green became a separate parish in 1894.&nbsp;
Years ago there was so little postal work that only one postman
was employed for the two parishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Three Coneys&rdquo; was the original name of what
is now known as &ldquo;The Bell and Hare.&rdquo;&nbsp; Passing by
Park-lane there were several good houses&mdash;one was called
&ldquo;The Cedars.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name was given to it on
account of two beautiful cedar trees in the garden, which were
planted by Queen Elizabeth on one of her visits to
Tottenham.&nbsp; The next house has been occupied by a doctor as
long as I remember, and the adjoining house, lately called
&ldquo;The Vicarage,&rdquo; was first used for that purpose when
the Rev. J. G. Hale was Vicar of All Hallows; prior to this it
was occupied by Capt. Goss, the first commanding officer of the
local Volunteers.&nbsp; The title deeds of the next house,
occupied by the late Mrs. Mudge, date back as far as the time of
Charles I.&nbsp; It has a basement kitchen, with very low
ceiling.&nbsp; The steps from the road lead into the
sitting-room, and when one has passed through the door there is
still a step to <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>be taken to get on the floor; the windows extending
below the level of the floor.</p>
<p>In the small house, which came next, James Filsell, the Parish
Clerk, lived.&nbsp; He had the care of the parish map; this is
now kept in the vestry room at All Hallows.</p>
<h2>THE DIAL HOUSE,</h2>
<p>which has a sun dial on the side of the house, dated 1691,
still stands to speak for itself.</p>
<h2>THE BLACK HOUSE</h2>
<p>was the peculiar name of a very old house which formerly stood
opposite White Hart-lane.&nbsp; It was partly built of brick and
partly of stone, with large iron gates before it.&nbsp; This
house belonged to a favourite of Henry VIII., named Hynningham,
whose family are buried in the church.&nbsp; Henry VIII.
frequently came here.&nbsp; In one of the rooms was an
inscription, &ldquo;In this chamber King Henry VIII. hath often
lyen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The remains of this house were in 1631 part of
the out-offices of Mr. Gerard Gore, in whose mansion Sir John
Coke, Secretary of State, resided during the summer months.&nbsp;
The same house was later on occupied by Sir Hugh Smithson, who on
the death of his wife&rsquo;s father became second Earl of
Northumberland.</p>
<p>In April, 1889, there was in the &ldquo;Quarterly
Review&rdquo; an interesting article on the &ldquo;Annals of the
House of Percy,&rdquo; from which it appears that the Duke and
Duchess of Somerset had a large family, of whom six attained
maturity.&nbsp; The oldest of these was Algernon, Earl of
Hertford.&nbsp; He married <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the daughter of Henry Thynne, and in
1722, on the death of his mother, he succeeded to her honours,
and was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Percy.&nbsp; He
had two children, Elizabeth, born in 1716, and George Lord
Beauchamp, born in 1725.&nbsp; When Lady Elizabeth Seymour was
twenty-three years old she paid a visit to her cousin, Lady
Lowther, at Swillington, and here she met Sir Hugh Smithson, a
Baronet of good family and possessing a large estate in
Yorkshire.&nbsp; The young people were mutually attracted.&nbsp;
Lady Elizabeth received his attentions with pleasure, and wrote
to her mother regarding his proposal of marriage that &ldquo;had
it met with my pappa&rsquo;s approbation, and your&rsquo;s, I
should very willingly have consented to it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Satisfactory answers having been received to questions as to Sir
Hugh&rsquo;s position, Lord and Lady Hertford gladly consented,
but the proud Duke of Somerset did not consider the alliance was
good enough for his grand-daughter.&nbsp; However, he at last
gave a grudging assent, mainly because the suitor was in the
present possession of an ample fortune, and had a good prospect
of a future inheritance from an uncle, old Mr. Smithson, of
Tottenham High Cross; but he made it plain to Lady Elizabeth that
he considered it her duty to stand out for more advantageous
terms than had satisfied her father and mother, for he said,
&ldquo;You are descended by many generations from the most
antient familys in England, and it is you that doth add antient
blood to Sir Hugh Smithson&rsquo;s family; he adds no such
antient blood to <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>your family.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the old uncle absolutely
declined to be tied up by any legal process, saying &ldquo;It was
true, he was no Duke, nor boasted of any such great alliance, but
in point of honourable dealing he would yield to no
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Duke being at last satisfied, the marriage
was solemnized on the 18th July, 1740.&nbsp; The happy pair did
not lose much time before they paid a visit of state to the kind
uncle who had paved the way to happiness for them, she in a
silver stuff of four pounds a yard, and Sir Hugh in a lead colour
and silver stuff embroidered with silver.&nbsp; For four years
life ran smoothly for them, and then suddenly, in the autumn of
1744, young Lord Beauchamp died of small-pox at Bologna, and Lady
Elizabeth Smithson became sole heiress of the honours which her
father had inherited from his mother, the last of the
Percys.&nbsp; The Duke of Somerset was furious at the extinction
of all hope of the direct continuance of his honours.&nbsp; He
had always hated his daughter-in-law, Lady Hertford, and he now
included his son in that hatred, to whom, as Horace Walpole said,
&ldquo;he wrote the most shocking letter imaginable,&rdquo;
telling him that it is a judgment upon him for all his
undutifulness, and that he must always look upon himself as the
cause of his son&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The old Duke petitioned the King to confer upon him the
Earldom of Northumberland, with remainder, after his son&rsquo;s
death, to his grandson Sir Charles Wyndham, and so to exclude
Lady Elizabeth, the rightful heiress.&nbsp; In this project he
was not successful, <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>and in due time Lady Elizabeth&rsquo;s husband became
Duke of Northumberland, assuming the surname of Percy.&nbsp;
Their married life was a very happy one; he was devoted to her,
and she returned the devotion, calling him &ldquo;my dearest
angel&rdquo; and &ldquo;joy of my soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; The house in
which they lived in Tottenham was taken down and a row of houses
erected, called &ldquo;Northumberland Row,&rdquo; the middle one
being named &ldquo;Percy House.&rdquo;&nbsp; In some of these
houses is some very curious carved work.&nbsp; Part of the old
house and part of the garden wall still remains next the
road.</p>
<p>Passing Northumberland Park there are still some old houses to
be seen before arriving at Union Court, which is on the boundary
of Tottenham and Edmonton.</p>
<p>Having spoken of the East side of the High-road, I will now
start again from Stamford Hill on the West side.</p>
<p>First came a large detached house standing in its own grounds
with a moat and a drawbridge.&nbsp; This drawbridge was last used
in the early part of last century, when a large number of gipsies
were seen approaching the house.</p>
<p>Mr. Josiah Wilson, J.P., lived next; it was also a large
detached house, which lay back a long distance from the
High-road, with large grounds attached.&nbsp; This was, I think,
the first house taken down on Stamford Hill, and from that time
dates the immense change that has taken place all over
Tottenham.&nbsp; Then there were a good many other large
residences, among which was the &ldquo;Clock House,&rdquo;
occupied by Miss <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>Deborah Dermer, and two pretty semi-detached houses at
the corner of the lane, then called Hanger-lane, now</p>
<h2>ST. ANN&rsquo;S ROAD.</h2>
<p>This was a very quiet road, with only a few cottages and one
or two good houses on the left hand side, and fields on the right
hand, as far as the four cross roads, where the Midland Railway
now crosses the road.</p>
<h2>HERMITAGE ROAD,</h2>
<p>leading from St. Ann&rsquo;s-road to the Green-lanes, was a
private road, the property of Mr. Scales.&nbsp; There were
beautiful fields on either side, and half way up on the left
stood four good houses, each standing in its own grounds.&nbsp;
First came &ldquo;Bridge House,&rdquo; where Mr. Shirley Hibberd
at one time resided.&nbsp; He was particularly fond of ivy, and
had twenty-five different varieties growing in his garden.</p>
<p>Next was &ldquo;The Retreat,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Vale
House,&rdquo; of which the last occupier was Mr. San
Giorgie.&nbsp; He kept an emu in the field opposite his house;
children all round were very fond of going to see it.&nbsp;
Lastly came &ldquo;The Swiss Cottage.&rdquo;&nbsp; The road was
enclosed with park gates at each end.&nbsp; In those days it was
a charming walk; now the aspect is entirely changed, the estate
being covered with houses.</p>
<h2>HANGER GREEN.</h2>
<p>Opposite to this was a farm known as St. John&rsquo;s
Farm.&nbsp; A little further on there was a pretty house and
large grounds, where Mr. John Robbins lived, the son-in-law of
Mr. Newsam, who built St. Ann&rsquo;s Church, <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Schools,
etc.&nbsp; The Metropolitan Fever Hospital now stands on this
site.&nbsp; A little further on, on the opposite side of the
road, there was another farm, with cottage, having a verandah
covered with white clematis which blossomed freely every
year.</p>
<p>We now return to the High-road.&nbsp; Sherboro House School
stood at the corner of Hanger-lane, one or two fields next to it,
and then two large detached houses stood close together in their
own grounds, well back from the road.&nbsp; These had fences of
cleft oak palings; outside this was a strip of waste land
turfed.&nbsp; Then a narrow ditch or water course, more turf
enclosed with low white posts, and chains painted green, which
gave it a very pretty and novel effect.&nbsp; Then more fields
extended to the end of the road called the New-road, so called
when it was completed in 1833 opening a thoroughfare from the
High-road to Gloucester Gate, Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; It was a
quiet road and very lonely at night.&nbsp; There were only two
houses before one reached the &ldquo;Manor House,&rdquo; where
Queen Victoria alighted on her return journey from Cambridge in
the year 1843.&nbsp; Close by was Hornsey Wood, and Hornsey Wood
Tavern, where on Saturday afternoons noblemen came from the West
End in four-horse coaches to practice rifle shooting.&nbsp; I
remember hearing my mother say the nurse had taken me for a walk
in the wood and lost her way, and after wandering about for some
time was finally obliged to climb a tree to see what direction to
take for the way out.&nbsp; On the left was the famous
&ldquo;Sluice House&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eel Pie House.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The wood was cleared, <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>and the land added to that purchased
to form Finsbury Park.&nbsp; Where the New River Bridge crosses
the road there was on the left hand side a large house called
&ldquo;River House&rdquo; in occupation of Mrs. Heathcote.</p>
<p>The West End omnibus ran to and fro three times daily.&nbsp;
The fare was one shilling and sixpence each way.&nbsp; Mr.
Willan, of The Hale Farm, was the proprietor.</p>
<p>This road is now known as the Seven Sisters-road, at the north
corner of which there stood a pretty white detached house, with
waste land in front, enclosed with posts and chains.&nbsp; It was
called &ldquo;Suffield Lodge,&rdquo; and occupied by Mr.
Bonny.</p>
<h2>BLACK-UP OR BLACKHOPE LANE,</h2>
<p>now called West Green-road.&nbsp; The grounds of the
last-mentioned house extended some distance up the lane; then
there were two large semi-detached houses with gardens in front
and rear, belonging to, and the first occupied by Mr. John
Beadnell.&nbsp; Then again fields and two cottages, and a small
inn called &ldquo;The Fountain&rdquo;; then a terrace of good
sized houses with large gardens, called Gloucester-terrace; then
more fields to the end of the road, where stood two large
semi-detached houses at the corner of &ldquo;Spratt&rsquo;s
Row,&rdquo; now called &ldquo;Dagmar-road.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>WEST GREEN.</h2>
<p>There was a pond in the middle of the green, railed all round,
with an opening for cattle to be able to get to the water.&nbsp;
A little distance further on was an estate called Lords
Grove.&nbsp; Facing the pond there was an old-fashioned white
house called &ldquo;Gothic <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Cottage,&rdquo; with garden and
fields extending some distance down Blackup-lane; then all fields
till one reached a large white house with verandah covered with
beautiful creepers standing in its own grounds, with meadow
beyond.&nbsp; The last tenant and owner was Richard Anstey
Simmonds.&nbsp; He had the walls of his dining and drawing-room
hand-painted, having artists from London to do it.&nbsp;
Unfortunately the firm in which he placed all his money failed,
and as it was before the time of limited liability, he was
absolutely ruined.&nbsp; A subscription was started, to which the
public generously responded, as every one was very sorry for
him.</p>
<h2>THE GROVE.</h2>
<p>This was a very pretty sheltered place.&nbsp; There was a row
of fine lime trees, and one especially beautiful chestnut tree in
the middle.&nbsp; It was well turfed and enclosed with white
posts and rails.</p>
<h2>GROVE HOUSE.</h2>
<p>Years ago this house was occupied by Mr. Ardesoif, a noted
cook-fighter.&nbsp; He was once so enraged by his bird losing his
bet that he threw it on a large fire.&nbsp; Grove House was
afterwards occupied by Mr. Thomas Smith, the then Lord of the
Manor.&nbsp; There is no house now attached to the Manor of
Tottenham.&nbsp; The Society of Friends afterwards established a
large boys&rsquo; school there, generally known as the
Quakers&rsquo; School.&nbsp; This is now used for the Polytechnic
and the Magistrates&rsquo; Court.</p>
<h2><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>TOTTENHAM GREEN.</h2>
<p>There was a large brick house, called &ldquo;Eagle
House,&rdquo; which was afterwards used for a boys&rsquo;
school.&nbsp; This was destroyed by fire, and Mr. Chassereau, the
owner, had Norma-villas and Eagle-avenue erected on the
site.&nbsp; Eaton House came next; Miss Toogood was owner and
occupier.&nbsp; Then there was a very old-fashioned white-fronted
house, which was unoccupied for a great many years, and the
garden became overgrown with thistles and weeds.&nbsp; A Quaker
lady named Coare kept a school here, and it was the scene of my
mother&rsquo;s earliest school days.&nbsp; About the year 1845
the house was demolished and two semi-detached houses
erected.&nbsp; The tenant of one house kept a horse and chaise
with a hood to it, and as there was no side entrance or
accommodation for either, the horse was always led through the
hall into the garden, where a temporary shed was erected, and the
chaise was kept in the front garden, opposite the drawing-room
window.&nbsp; Then came two large detached houses, only one of
which now stands.&nbsp; The other, with the two white houses just
mentioned, also Eaton House, were recently purchased by the
Tottenham Urban District Council, and the Municipal Buildings
erected.&nbsp; Lastly came a pretty white house, the residence of
Mr. Benjamin Godfrey Windus.&nbsp; He was the possessor of some
very fine paintings by Turner, and once a week he kindly allowed
the public to see them, by ticket of admission.&nbsp; A few years
after his death the house was taken down.&nbsp; With gardens,
orchards, and meadows the land comprised <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>31 acres, 3
rods, 37 poles, and reached up what was then called West
Green-road (now Philip-lane) as far as where the last of
Stowe-villas now stands.&nbsp; Then there were fields as far as
West Green Common.</p>
<p>Crossing over the road there was a good sized house and
grounds.&nbsp; Next came a field with a stile at each end and
footpath across.&nbsp; By the side of the field there was a road
or carriage drive to</p>
<h2>DOWNHILLS.</h2>
<p>This was the property of Rowland Stephenson, Esq., and when he
died it was, in 1808, offered for sale by auction by Messrs.
Skinner, Dyke, Tuckin, and Forest, at Garraway&rsquo;s Coffee
House, Change Alley, London, in seven lots.&nbsp; The house was
described as &ldquo;The truly desirable residence of the late
Rowland Stephenson, Esq., situated at Mount Pleasant, West Green,
Tottenham, on a delightful eminence, commanding rich and
picturesque prospects and agreeably remove from the public roads,
and forming one of the most complete residences in the
county.&rdquo;&nbsp; The estate included a productive farm and
lands containing three hundred and thirty acres, lying nearly
within a ring fence.&nbsp; At this time the House was called
&ldquo;Mount Pleasant.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I first knew it it was
known as &ldquo;Downhills.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later on for a short time
it was called &ldquo;Uplands,&rdquo; but in its last days was
again called Downhills, when it was purchased by the Tottenham
Urban District Council.</p>
<p>Across the fields by the house there was a public footpath,
and it was a pretty walk leading to where Hornsey turnpike gate
then <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>stood.&nbsp; Not far from this was the very quaint old
house called &ldquo;Duckett&rsquo;s Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to West Green-road one next came to a very large
house, the residence of Henry Scambler, of Scambler&rsquo;s
Livery Stables, City.&nbsp; Later on his nephew Thomas Owden
lived there.&nbsp; He was Alderman, and in due time Lord Mayor of
London.&nbsp; The house lay some distance back from the road, and
was approached by a long straight carriage drive, with beautiful
meadows on both sides.&nbsp; The estate was 31 acres 3 rods 39
poles in extent.&nbsp; The garden of the lodge was a sight to
behold, especially in the spring time, when it was gay with
flowers of every hue.&nbsp; Then there were four large houses,
and adjoining a stretch of beautiful fields.&nbsp; The two first
belonged to Mr. Robert Forster, where we children spent many a
happy hour in haymaking time.&nbsp; The next belonged to Mr. Wm.
Fowler, the banker.&nbsp; There, after haymaking was over, horses
which were ill and required medical care were taken into graze,
and it was a very pretty sight to see them march in a body to
meet the veterinary surgeon when they saw him coming.&nbsp; It
showed how grateful they were for his skill and kind
attention.&nbsp; On the left hand side, where the fields belonged
to Mount Pleasant Estate, there was a footpath across these
fields into Lordship-lane.&nbsp; West Green-road was very
lonely.&nbsp; Two young ladies, friends of mine, were walking
alone, when just by these fields two tramps appeared and
commenced taking off their jackets and dresses to steal
them.&nbsp; Fortunately just at this moment a gentleman drove <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>down the
lane, and attracted by the children&rsquo;s cries he came to
their rescue.&nbsp; The tramps immediately made off, and he
kindly drove the frightened girls to their parents&rsquo;
house.&nbsp; Mr. Robert Forster lived, with his sisters, in the
old-fashioned house that came next, and they built the almshouses
that stand on part of their land, and called them
&ldquo;Forster&rsquo;s Almshouses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Round the bend of
the road there were two large white houses.&nbsp; Mr. William
Janson lived in the first, and in later years the other was
occupied by Mr. Joseph Howard.&nbsp; He was the first member of
Parliament for Tottenham, when in 1885 the ancient Parish of
Tottenham and Wood Green was made into a separate constituency,
and continued to be its Parliamentary representative for 20
years.&nbsp; Then came two good houses; next to these was a large
garden and builder&rsquo;s yard and house, occupied by Thomas
Ashwell.&nbsp; On these premises was the room used for the
infants&rsquo; school belonging to Trinity Church.&nbsp; It was
also used for missionary meetings.</p>
<h2>TOTTENHAM GREEN.</h2>
<p>is the property of Sir William Curtis Baronet, the Lord of the
Manor, and he gave a portion of it to the parish for the erection
of Holy Trinity Church in 1829.&nbsp; In May, 1830, Holy Trinity,
which was the Chapel of Ease to the Parish Church, was
consecrated.&nbsp; The first minister appointed was the Rev.
George Hodson Thompson.&nbsp; He lived at the corner of Page
Green, and was succeeded by the Rev. George Brewster
Twining.&nbsp; In the centre of the Church were benches which <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>were free,
and there were doors to the pews; there was always a full
congregation.&nbsp; The gallery was mostly used for the children
of the Green School on one side, and on the other the boys from
Sherboro House School, Stamford Hill, of which Dr. Williams was
the Principal.&nbsp; Mr. Barton was the organist, Peter Rickard
the clerk, and the pew-opener was Mrs. Perrin.&nbsp; Occasionally
the Rev. Mr. Newcome, the Vicar of All Hallows, would take the
service.&nbsp; Once he told the congregation he would he unable
to preach as he had left his spectacles at home.&nbsp; My
grandmother called the pew-opener and sent him hers, which
fortunately suited his sight.&nbsp; In those days a clergyman
could hold two livings at a time.&nbsp; He was Vicar of
Tottenham, and also of Shenley, where he resided.&nbsp; He used
often to come and see my father, and always gave my mother his
blessing.&nbsp; I remember once hearing him say, &ldquo;I give
you my blessing my dear, and oh what a pretty gown you have
on!&rdquo;&nbsp; At one time a lady living on the Green who was
one of the congregation, asked my father, as churchwarden, to
have the middle post at the entrance moved to make a wider space
as she was so stout she could not get through.&nbsp; He at once
complied with her request.&nbsp; I must not forget to mention how
beautifully the churchyard was turfed, and how lovely it looked
with the long-stalked white daisies.&nbsp; On coming out of
Church I occasionally gave way to the temptation of gathering a
few, although my mother used to say I ought not to do so,
particularly on Sundays.&nbsp; I used to wonder why it was worse
to do it on Sundays than other days.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>I must
not forget to mention at one time the organist played a voluntary
between the prayers and the Litany, but it was discontinued as it
was not generally liked.</p>
<p>For a great many years Mr. Twining rented a cottage in
&ldquo;Bull-row&rdquo; to provide a home for four poor old
women.&nbsp; They had one room each, and were very thankful for
it.</p>
<p>There was always a large bonfire and fireworks on the Green on
the 5th of November.&nbsp; This was discontinued when the traffic
increased, as it frightened the horses.&nbsp; Boys used to play
cricket here, and horses and cows were allowed to graze.&nbsp; On
the occasion of the marriage of the Prince of Wales, now our King
Edward VII., we had a captive balloon on the Green, and anyone
who liked to ascend could do so.&nbsp; John Fowler, the beadle,
availed himself of the offer.&nbsp; He did not appreciate the
trip, as it made him feel very ill.</p>
<p>The large tree in the middle of the Green, by the High-road, I
well remember being planted by Mr. Deane, of &ldquo;The
Yews,&rdquo; a great authority on parish matters.&nbsp; Some of
the trees on the East Green were planted by Mr. Twining&rsquo;s
son and my brother when they were boys.</p>
<p>We next come to the High Cross Pump.&nbsp; The well was dug
and the pump erected at the expense of Mr. Thomas Smith, the Lord
of the Manor, in the early part of last century, in consideration
of his having been allowed to enclose a piece of waste land, near
Grove House, where he resided.&nbsp; The water from this pump
supplied a large portion of the parish, and many people earned
their <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>living by taking it about in barrels upon wheels,
selling it at a penny a pail.&nbsp; In 1883 the well was
closed.</p>
<p>The White Swan Inn at the opposite corner of the road had a
small railed-in garden at the side in which stood a high white
pole surmounted by a large white swan.&nbsp; This inn was a
favourite resort of Izaak Walton, the famous angler.&nbsp; He
often came to Tottenham to enjoy fishing in the River Lea, and
rested, as one may read in &ldquo;The Compleat Angler,&rdquo;
&ldquo;in the sweet shady arbour which Nature herself has woven
with her own fingers; &rsquo;tis such a contexture of woodbines,
sweet briar, jessamine and myrtle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adjoining were a lot of small, old-fashioned houses; a narrow
entrance called High Cross Court, with cottages in the
rear.&nbsp; There was a large carriage factory next, with a yard
and more cottages, and the builder&rsquo;s house in the front;
three more houses, then the two houses, in the first of which Dr.
Edward Curtis May, father of the present Dr. Edward Hooper May,
lived.&nbsp; Tottenham at that time could only boast of two
doctors&mdash;Dr. Holt and Dr. May.&nbsp; I always think with
pleasure of the mansion that came next; it was here I spent such
happy days at school, the three Misses Wilson were such kind and
considerate teachers.&nbsp; It was a boarding school, but my
sister and I, with a few others, were day boarders.&nbsp; We had
to rise early, have our breakfast, and be at school at 7 a.m.,
say our lessons with the boarders, and then while they were
breakfasting we learnt our lessons for the next day.&nbsp; The <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>house was
called &ldquo;The Elms.&rdquo;&nbsp; In front of it stood a
magnificent row of elm trees; at the back was a large garden, and
beyond that a meadow.&nbsp; My father sold this estate to the
Drapers&rsquo; Company about 1848, when the house was taken down
and a school for boys and two rows of almshouses built.</p>
<p>The houses after this were all small and, I may say,
uninteresting, and reached as far as the field, which Mr. Robert
Forster used as a brickfield.&nbsp; Here there was a pond, and
the well, known as St. Loy&rsquo;s Well, in a field adjoining,
about 500 ft. from the High-road.&nbsp; This well was said to be
always full but never running over, and the properties to be the
same as the waters of the Cheltenham Springs.&nbsp; It was
cleaned out in the sixteenth century, and at the bottom was found
a great stone having certain letters or characters on it, but
unfortunately the workmen carelessly broke and defaced it, so it
was not known what the characters meant.</p>
<p>The houses next were only medium-sized as far as &ldquo;The
Old Ship Inn,&rdquo; which was then a long, low, rambling
building one story high and attics.&nbsp; At the corner by Bruce
Grove there was Myers&rsquo; the builders&rsquo; and
stonemasons&rsquo; yard and two good houses, one occupied by Miss
Keating, sister to the Keating of cough lozenge fame, the corner
one by Dr. Edward Curtis May after he left the High Cross.&nbsp;
These were all pulled down and the great Eastern Railway Station
built on the site.</p>
<h2>BRUCE GROVE.</h2>
<p>This was a quiet retired spot; the houses were all good, some
very large, and nearly <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>all were occupied by Quakers.&nbsp;
Mr. William Fowler&rsquo;s house, at the end, had beautiful
grounds, the meadows extending to the end of the narrow walk
leading to Bruce Castle.&nbsp; Flocks of rooks made their nests
and found a shelter in the trees there.&nbsp; It was so peaceful,
with fields on either side, with a low open iron railing.&nbsp;
The only sound to be heard was the caw caw of the rooks who
always seemed as if they had something important to discuss, and
they left off reluctantly when their bedtime came.</p>
<p>On the North side was a row of very old and noble elm
trees.&nbsp; By the side of the middle one stood a box which was
a shelter for a &ldquo;Charley.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charleys were the
precursors of policemen.&nbsp; One of their duties was to call
out every half-hour the time, and the state of the weather.&nbsp;
I remember hearing &ldquo;half-past nine, and a fine starry
night,&rdquo; or &ldquo;ten o&rsquo;clock and a foggy
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their life was not altogether an enviable
one.&nbsp; It occasionally happened that some young men,
returning home rather late, thought it a joke to upset the box
with the Charley inside, and there he had to stay till by some
means or other he was liberated.</p>
<p>Many years ago there lived in one of the houses here a lady
who thought and said she was unable to move from her chair.&nbsp;
The doctor who was attending her assured her again and again that
it was only her imagination.&nbsp; As she still persisted in
refusing to try, he determined to prove to her that it was
possible; so on his next visit, after talking to her for some
time, he got up and rang the bell.&nbsp; On her asking his reason
he replied <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>he wished to speak to his coachman.&nbsp; When the maid
came in response to the ring he requested her to send him
up.&nbsp; The lady, in amazement said, &ldquo;What can you want
with your coachman in my bedroom, doctor?&rdquo;&nbsp; He simply
replied, &ldquo;You will see, madam.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man came
and received the order, &ldquo;Bring up a truss of straw,&rdquo;
which he did, and was told to put it under that lady&rsquo;s
chair and set light to it; but before this could be done up
sprang the lady, and from that day no more was heard of her
refusal to move, and the doctor congratulated himself on his
success.&nbsp; At that time there were several doctors living in
Tottenham who did not practise here, one of them being a friend
of a lady living in Bruce Grove and who attended her through an
illness.&nbsp; When she quite recovered he told her he should not
be coming again for a little while as she was so much
better.&nbsp; She told him she hoped he would continue his
visits, as the truth was she had taken a fancy to him, and would
like to be his wife.&nbsp; Unfortunately he was not of the same
mind.</p>
<p>The Crossway Path was a pretty walk leading to Love-lane,
which was a narrow lane running parallel with the High-road to
White Hart-lane.&nbsp; Part of this lane is now
Pembury-road.&nbsp; In 1871, when the G.E.R. bridge was erected,
this path was closed.</p>
<p>At the corner of Bruce Grove was a lodge, and where
Maitland-terrace now stands was a long and very pretty garden
rented by Mr. William Janson; at the end of this he had
&ldquo;The Lecture Hall&rdquo; built, which was used for <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>a library and
different kinds of entertainments.&nbsp; As the facilities for
getting to town were not what they are now, it was a great boon
to the neighbourhood.&nbsp; We spent many a pleasant evening
there, but after a time it was not successful.&nbsp; I have been
told that in its latter days the hall was engaged by some nigger
minstrels for an entertainment.&nbsp; The evening arrived and a
good audience assembled in hopes of having an enjoyable
time.&nbsp; After waiting patiently, and as the entertainment did
not commence, some one went to enquire the reason, when directly
one of the performers came on the platform and sang, &ldquo;We
are going to skedaddle, skedaddle, skedaddle; we&rsquo;re going
to skedaddle away,&rdquo; and then ran back into the
retiring-room.&nbsp; The audience laughed, thinking this was part
of the performance and waited still longer; but getting impatient
enquiries were again made, when it was found the minstrels had
been as good as their word.&nbsp; Not finding them in the
retiring-room, some one looked out of the front door and saw the
last one in the act of getting in the omnibus, which at once
drove off.&nbsp; They took the admission money with them, and
were never heard of again.</p>
<p>For many years this hall was then used by the Plymouth
Brethren, as their place of worship.&nbsp; When Mr.
Janson&rsquo;s lease expired the hall was let to the Tottenham
Constitutional Club.&nbsp; There used to be four houses next,
with gardens in front.&nbsp; These were taken down and the
sorting office and the London and Provincial Bank built.&nbsp;
When this Bank was first opened the business was <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>carried on in
one of the shops in Commerce-terrace opposite.</p>
<p>Adjoining Bruce Grove House, where Dr. Vos now lives, is the
carriage factory, the business of which was for so many years
carried on by Messrs. Glover and Sons.&nbsp; One son had a most
miraculous escape from death.&nbsp; During a very heavy
thunderstorm, not feeling well, he went upstairs to lie
down.&nbsp; Some time after, feeling better, he went downstairs
again.&nbsp; He had only just left the room when a thunderbolt
fell on his bed, on the very spot where he had been lying.</p>
<p>The private roadway at the side led to the Tottenham Brewery
(then kept by Messrs. Fullagar and Freeman) and ended in
Love-lane.&nbsp; Adjoining Charlton Cottage was the house Dr.
Holt lived in; one of the two doctors then practising in
Tottenham.&nbsp; He was succeeded by Dr. Hall, who was so well
known.</p>
<p>But all this part is so little altered that description is
unnecessary until one comes to Moulding&rsquo;s Carriage Factory,
which was built in the year 1871 on the ground where Messrs.
Larkins, the brewers, had a kind of storehouse.&nbsp; This
factory was burned down in 1881, and in the course of a very
short time re-built.</p>
<h2>LORDSHIP HALL.</h2>
<p>This was the next place of interest.&nbsp; The grounds, nearly
twelve acres in extent, were enclosed in a high brick wall, which
went all round.&nbsp; The lodge stood at the corner of what is
now Pembury-road, and through the gates one could catch a glimpse
of the <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>beautiful hydrangeas, and other flowers bordering the
carriage drive, leading to the mansion, which stood not far from
Lordship-lane.&nbsp; It was a good old house, with a fine
entrance hall; it struck me as being very gloomy upstairs, the
bedroom doors all being painted black.&nbsp; There were many
pretty, shady walks in the gardens and fields; in one part was a
nut walk.</p>
<p>When the hall was pulled down in 1867 a portion of the ground
was thrown out to widen Lordship-lane, which was at that time
very narrow.</p>
<p>There was a row of pretty, small cottages on the right-hand
side of the lane, several of them built of wood.&nbsp; The
tenants took great pains with their gardens and grape vines,
which were covered with bunches of white grapes.&nbsp; The houses
that came next, called Bruce-terrace, were built by Mr. Thomas
Finney, an ironfounder.&nbsp; They have one
peculiarity&mdash;each house has an iron step at the gateway in
lieu of stone.&nbsp; From this point to Bruce Castle grounds
there were fields on both sides.&nbsp; On the left-hand side
there was a row of majestic elm trees.&nbsp; The white house in
the middle of the field was the residence of Mr. Francis Fox.</p>
<h2>BRUCE CASTLE.</h2>
<p>Bruce Castle has always had a fascination for me, thinking of
the changes that have taken place since Robert Bruce, father of
Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, who died in 1303, lived in the
castellated mansion that formerly occupied the site.&nbsp; Later
on, when it came into the possession of Sir <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>William
Compton, he re-built it, and again it seems associated with
Scotland, for on the Saturday after Ascension Day, in 1516, King
Henry VIII. met his sister, Margaret, Queen of Scots, at
&ldquo;Maister Compton&rsquo;s house beside Tottnam.&rdquo;&nbsp;
One can imagine the scene that was enacted there, when Sir
William&rsquo;s grandson, Henry Lord Compton, was honoured by a
visit from Queen Elizabeth in May, 1578.&nbsp; History says the
Castle was repaired, and almost re-built, in the latter part of
the Seventeenth Century, by Henry Lord Coleraine, who succeeded
the Comptons.&nbsp; He removed the arms of Compton from the old
porch, and placed them over the entrance of the inside, out of
respect to that illustrious family.&nbsp; At this time there was
stabling for twelve horses, and a treble coach-house, with lofts
over.&nbsp; Gradually the glory of the place departed; it passed
from owner to owner, and when Mr. Ede, a merchant, of London,
purchased it in 1814, these stables and coach-houses were pulled
down.&nbsp; Up till the early part of last Century the principal
entrance was in the centre of the Castle, and on either side of
the door orange and lemon trees were growing in large tubs, which
gave it a very pretty appearance.&nbsp; This door was afterwards
closed, and the entrance made at the side.&nbsp; In 1827 Mr. Ede
sold the mansion, with 15 acres of pleasure grounds, gardens,
etc., to Messrs. Hill, who started a boys&rsquo; school, which
was under their management for fifty years.&nbsp; It is
interesting to know that Sir Rowland Hill, to whom we are
indebted for the Penny Postage Stamp, was one of the joint
purchasers.&nbsp; In <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>1877 the Rev. W. Almack, M.A., took
over the school, and it remained in his hands until the school
was dissolved in 1890, when Mr. Pedley rented the Castle and
grounds for two years, and during this time the building was used
for a Loan and Industrial Exhibition.&nbsp; The estate was
finally sold for the use of the public, and called Bruce Castle
Park.&nbsp; Till within quite recent years the trees and bushes
in the front of the Castle were a sight to behold when out in
full bloom&mdash;white and pink horse-chestnuts, laburnum, white
and pink may, guelder roses, and lilac.&nbsp; The ivy was so
thick and broad on the top of the wall for some distance down
Lordship-lane that it formed quite a verandah.&nbsp; During a
heavy storm a great part was blown down.&nbsp; In olden times a
curious custom prevailed at Bruce Castle: When any of the family
died the corpse was not allowed to be carried through the gate,
so an opening was made in the wall near the Church, and through
this the coffin was taken.&nbsp; In the time when corpses could
be arrested for debt a man died there and, owing to this custom,
the family were able to get the corpse into the churchyard before
the creditors could claim the body.&nbsp; When the last aperature
was opened a Gothic door was fixed in its place.</p>
<h2>ALL HALLOWS.</h2>
<p>At the beginning of last Century the Parish Church, dedicated
to All Saints, was the only church in Tottenham, and although
smaller than at present it was large enough for the number of
worshippers.&nbsp; But as the <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>number of inhabitants increased,
although other churches had been erected, it was necessary to
enlarge it, and in 1876 the new chancel was built, north and
south transepts, an organ chamber, double vestries, and a north
porch added, and what was formerly the old chancel absorbed in
the nave, and the new roofs made considerably higher than the
old.&nbsp; For my part, I like to think of the &ldquo;Old
Church,&rdquo; as we used to call it, as it was when I was a
child, with the high pews with doors to them, two of which were
square, with seats all round, like a little room.&nbsp; One of
these was allotted to the tenant of the Moat House, Tottenham
Park.&nbsp; The centre alley of the nave was paved with grave
stones, but they were so worn by time that in many cases the
inscriptions were nearly obliterated.&nbsp; There was a gallery
at each side, and one at the west end, where the girls from the
Blue School sat.&nbsp; The organ was in this gallery; Mr. Stone
was the organist for a great many years.&nbsp; On the wall of the
gallery on the south side were placed all the Hatchments that had
been taken from the large houses in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The
other gallery was private; built and presented to the church by
three gentlemen of the congregation.&nbsp; The pulpit was a
three-decker; the lower part was where the minister stood to read
the lessons, and by the side was the sort of box, where the
Parish Clerk sat.&nbsp; One of his duties was to say all the
&ldquo;Amens,&rdquo; and also to read the alternate verses of the
Psalms, etc.&nbsp; We children used to look forward with pleasure
to hearing Psalm lxxiv., for when it came <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>to the
eleventh verse, to our great amusement, old James Filsell always
said: &ldquo;Why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
&lsquo;buzzum.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The Vicar then was the Rev.
Thomas Newcome, who lived at Shenley; he was also Vicar of that
parish, and it was only occasionally he came to Tottenham to take
the service.&nbsp; He never failed to come on the 25th Sunday
after Trinity, and my recollection of him is hearing him say, in
loud and impressive tones, the collect beginning, &ldquo;Stir up,
we beseech Thee, O Lord, the wills of Thy faithful
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; The strong accent on the first two words
always made them sound &ldquo;Stour oop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We only had morning and afternoon service, and as it used to
get dusk on winter afternoons the pew opener placed two flat
brass candlesticks on the top of the last pew on either side of
the aisle to light the congregation out.&nbsp; It was not a
brilliant illumination, but it served every purpose.</p>
<p>The next Vicar was the Rev. W. J. Hall.&nbsp; During the
latter part of his time some of the congregation wished to have
an evening service, and offered to pay for a minister from London
to conduct it; but on talking it over with Mr. Forster&rsquo;s
father, his remark was, &ldquo;I am getting into years, Forster,
and so are you; so we will not consent to it, and if any one
wishes for an evening service there are other churches to which
they can go.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Hale, who succeeded Mr. Hall,
willingly agreed to the request.</p>
<p>Over the Altar at the East there was a beautiful window of
ancient painted glass divided into eight compartments, containing
<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>the
representations of St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, with smaller
figures of David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah.&nbsp; It was given to the
Church in 1807 by John Eardly Wilmot, who then resided at Bruce
Castle.&nbsp; The other windows were all plain glass.</p>
<p>The most remarkable monument in the Church, of fine white
marble, against the upper end of the north wall, was erected to
the memory of Maria, the daughter of Richard Wilcocks, of
Tottenham, and the wife of Sir Robert Barkham, of Wainfleet, in
the County of Lincoln, who died in 1644.&nbsp; The monument is
ornamented with the busts of the deceased and her husband; Sir
Robert being represented in armour, with a peaked beard and
whiskers, holding a book in one hand; and his wife habited in
veil, necklace, handkerchief, and stomacher, very richly
ornamented with lace, also with a book in one hand and resting
the other on a skull.&nbsp; On the base of the monument are on a
black ground the effigies in white marble of four sons on one
side and eight daughters on the other in praying attitude; the
first on each side kneeling to a desk with a book on it.&nbsp;
One of the children on either side is represented as deceased,
and laid wrapped in a shroud, with a death&rsquo;s head under the
pillow.</p>
<p>Underneath the painted window the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the
Ten Commandments were written, and on either side of the Altar
rails were two large boards covered with leather; on these was
written in letters of gold an account of the bequests to the
Parish.</p>
<p>Formerly the Vestries used to be held in <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>the
Vestry-room, but as the population increased, and there was more
business to be done, the accommodation was not sufficient, and so
they were held, first at the Lecture Hall, and afterwards at the
Drill Hall, and now at the Bruce Grove Board School.</p>
<p>The bell that is known as the saints or vestry bell was given
to the Church in 1801 by Humphrey Jackson, Esq., M.D., who lived
for many years in White Hart-lane.&nbsp; This bell has upon it an
ornamented cross on which are fleur-de-lis and on the upper part
the inscription &ldquo;Sit nomen Domine Benedictum I.H., Fecit,
1663,&rdquo; together with two medals and an ornamental
border.&nbsp; On the lower part there are other medals, on one of
which is a representation of the Virgin and Child.&nbsp; This
bell was the alarm bell to the garrison of Quebec, and was
appropriated by some drunken sailors during the siege of that
place by the force under General Townsend.&nbsp; It is believed
there is a quantity of silver in its composition, which accounts
for its melodious sound.</p>
<p>In former years some poor pensioner was allowed to make a home
in the room over the porch.&nbsp; The last was Betty
Fleming.&nbsp; She kept a great many cats, and used to place
saucers with milk for them all round the churchyard.&nbsp; She
died in 1790, aged 100 years, having lived in that room forty
years.</p>
<p>A dog would not be permitted to enter a church now, but I
remember when Charles Bradford (old blind Charlie as he was
called) was led in by his dog, and it remained with <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>him all the
service, so quiet that no one would have known it was there.</p>
<p>One Sunday evening in the summer of 1876 there was a terrific
storm.&nbsp; All through the sermon it had been getting darker
and darker, and when the last hymn was being sung the storm broke
out in great fury, the last verse had to be omitted, and the
Vicar gave the Benediction.&nbsp; The noise was deafening; the
hailstones were immense; they smashed the Lanthorne light, and
glass was flying in all directions.&nbsp; Outside the water was
so deep that those who attempted to leave the church were obliged
to come back.&nbsp; To add to the confusion one lady went into
hysterics.&nbsp; Some one covered her with a waterproof so that
she should not see the lightning.&nbsp; Fortunately I had a
bottle of strong smelling salts with me, which I sent to her, and
after a time she recovered.&nbsp; Everyone, I believe, was
frightened; some were deadly pale, and it was a great relief to
all of us when the storm abated.&nbsp; But many people had cause
to remember it as it did so much damage, destroying the crops in
the market gardens and smashing such quantities of glass.</p>
<p>At one time the churchyard was sufficient, not only for
Tottenham, but for Wood Green as well, and one could wander over
the grass and amongst the graves.&nbsp; There were not any very
curious epitaphs; one I thought very beautiful was on a stone
erected to the memory of a pupil at Bruce Castle.&nbsp; It
commenced, &ldquo;Far from his native home the little Sulliot
came.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another was written, &ldquo;Charlotte, we
shall meet <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>again.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stone was erected by a man who
lost his wife.&nbsp; But after a time his grief subsided, and he
married again, whereupon he caused these words to be erased.</p>
<p>When the Church was altered the churchyard also underwent a
considerable change.&nbsp; The paths were diverted, and many of
the stones were removed to another part.&nbsp; One lady strongly
objected to having her family vault touched, and applied to the
Secretary of State to uphold her in her refusal, which he
did.&nbsp; Her reply to the Vicar when he asked her to reconsider
her decision was, &ldquo;Cursed is he who removeth his
neighbour&rsquo;s land-mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My grandmother was buried at the time there were
body-snatchers, and my mother was so afraid of her body being
disturbed, that, although she employed two men to keep watch, she
went accompanied by her maid at various hours of the night to see
that they were doing their duty, and always found them at their
post.&nbsp; It was a very lonely walk, but her love for her
mother made her brave.&nbsp; There was a watch-box on the north
side of the tower, and for a fortnight or three weeks after a
burial old David Hummett, who was one of the Charlies, kept
watch.&nbsp; I have heard that somewhere about this time a lady
was buried in Edmonton Churchyard wearing some very handsome
rings.&nbsp; This was much talked about, and some men for the
sake of the booty dug up the coffin that night, and opening it,
commenced to cut off her fingers as they were unable to remove
the rings.&nbsp; To their horror she sat up.&nbsp; They <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>made off as
quickly as they could, and she walked home to her husband&rsquo;s
house and rang at the bell and he opened the door to her.&nbsp;
What he felt no one can tell; at any rate it must have been a
shock to his nerves.&nbsp; She lived for some years after, and
this account was given to my mother by the nurse who attended the
lady when her baby was born.&nbsp; She was in a trance, so the
men&rsquo;s greed was fortunate for her, as it saved her
life.</p>
<h2>THE PRIORY,</h2>
<p>an old-fashioned residence adjoining the churchyard, was in
the year 1620 occupied by a Mr. Fenton.&nbsp; On the beautifully
carved ceiling of the dining-room his name appears thus: Fenton,
and an illustration of a barrel or tun.&nbsp; This design was
also found on some Dutch tiles which were part of the original
hearthstone.&nbsp; I remember Mrs. Hannah Wakeling living
here.&nbsp; She was the owner of &ldquo;Priory Side,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hornchurch,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bruce Lodge.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She left each house to the tenant who was living there at the
time of her death.</p>
<p>Scotlands is the name of the sexton&rsquo;s cottage&mdash;a
quaint, detached, wooden building on the east side of the
church.&nbsp; It was for a great many years occupied by Mr.
Joseph Forster, the sexton, and when he died his son, Mr. Alfred
Forster, who succeeded him, bought and enfranchised it.&nbsp;
Turning the corner by Rose Cottage, the bar, which was placed
there so many years ago to prevent vehicular traffic, still
stretches across the road.</p>
<h2><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>THE
CEMETERY.</h2>
<p>This was opened in January, 1858, a few years after the parish
purchased the ground on the north side, and since then it has
been much enlarged in the other direction.&nbsp; Continuing along
Lordship-lane, after passing Bruce Castle, on the left hand side
of the road, there stood two good residences, in the first of
which John Elliott Howard lived, and in the other Thomas
Fox.&nbsp; A short distance further the substantial farmhouse
&ldquo;Broadwaters&rdquo; occupied by John Phillips, a prominent
member of the Society of Friends.&nbsp; This farm was part of the
Downhills Estate, and was 220 acres in extent.&nbsp; Some
distance further up the lane was a small farm, then an unbroken
stretch of fields to the four cross roads.&nbsp; Passing Wood
Green Common, where there were several good houses, one came to
Tottenham Wood, an estate of 379 acres, the property of Thomas
Rhodes, a relative of Cecil Rhodes, of South African fame; when
he died it was sold to the Company who built the Alexandra Palace
there.&nbsp; It used to be said that whenever a fog, or mist,
rose out of Tottenham Wood, and hung over it like smoke, it was a
sign of rain and bad weather; the rhyme was:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Tottenham Wood is all on fire,<br />
Then Tottenham street is nought but mire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming back to the High-road, where the offices of the Gas
Company now stand was one of the many ponds for which Tottenham
was noted; then a large house called &ldquo;The
Ferns.&rdquo;&nbsp; My mother well remembered <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the mansion
which stood next; for many years her father dined there, every
other Sunday, with his friend William Salte.&nbsp; This was one
of the most conspicuous residences in the parish.&nbsp; In 1730
Philip De La Haize lived there; he was a wealthy London
merchant.&nbsp; At his death he bequeated the interest of
&pound;100 to the poor of the parish.&nbsp; Mr. Salte died in
1816.&nbsp; It was found impossible to let or sell the place as a
whole, so the house was pulled down, and the materials, with the
land, sold by auction, the materials alone realising
&pound;2,500, which shows that the house must have been very
substantial.&nbsp; There was a very handsome clock over the
stables; Mr. Salte had it made by Thwaites, of Clerkenwell; he
ordered it to be &ldquo;as good as any between London and
York,&rdquo; and it cost him &pound;400.&nbsp; At the sale it was
purchased by Miss Deborah Dermer for &pound;75, who had it fixed
on her residence, Coleraine House, Stamford Hill, which was from
that time known as the Clock House.&nbsp; The beautiful
wrought-iron gates were left.&nbsp; The land stood idle for so
many years that many considered it to be in Chancery, but this
was not the case.&nbsp; The reason devolved upon the question of
the heir-at-law.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Dermer, having a son or
daughter, Mr. Gripper, of the Bell Brewery, very much wished to
purchase it, but the risk was too great.&nbsp; A few years before
Mr. Dermer died he sold it to the Law Reversionary Society for a
mere trifle, who a short time after sold it to Messrs. Harper,
who built Criterion-buildings, Cedar-road (taking its name from
the noble cedar tree <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>which stood on the estate),
Ruskin-road, and Pembury-avenue.&nbsp; The land extended to the
grounds of Bruce Castle.</p>
<p>The row of houses called Moselle-terrace, lay back from the
road.&nbsp; In the enclosure a fountain was erected, the ground
having been bored to the depth of one hundred and nineteen feet,
the main spring was tapped and a plentiful supply of water
obtained.&nbsp; The fountain was in the form of a cast-iron
ornamental pedestal; the water rose about six feet from the
ground, and was discharged through the mouth of a dolphin about
18 inches from the ground.&nbsp; The pedestal was removed in
1839, and the water, instead of being allowed to run waste as
formerly, was conducted into a trough placed by the side of the
road for the use of cattle passing to the London markets.</p>
<h2>CHURCH ROAD.</h2>
<p>This used to be called The Nursery, as Charles Coleman had a
large nursery there.&nbsp; The ground was afterwards used for a
brickfield.&nbsp; Near Bruce Castle grounds was the Lancasterian
School for boys, supported by voluntary contributions.</p>
<p>Messrs. Le Gros, Thompson and Bird, crape finishers, had a
factory in Love-lane.&nbsp; This was burnt down in the year 1860,
and the business was then removed to Norwich.&nbsp; The manager,
James Bayliss, lived in the house in the front, which is now used
as a Convent School.</p>
<p>Whitehall House stood on the site, now covered with shops and
houses, known as Whitehall-terrace, Whitehall-street, and <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>Moselle-street.&nbsp; The estate consisted of between
six and seven acres of land.&nbsp; In one part of the pleasure
grounds there was a Serpentine Walk.&nbsp; The house was some
distance back from the road, and in the front was a beautiful
lake, with swans on it.&nbsp; Mr. Charles Soames was the owner
and occupier.</p>
<h2>WHITE HART LANE.</h2>
<p>At one time called Parsonage-lane.&nbsp; At the end of a
turning on the right-hand side was the old Roman Catholic Chapel,
which was used until the present Church was erected in the
High-road.&nbsp; The Grange needs no description, as it still
looks as it did in the days when I remember Miss Buckworth living
there.&nbsp; After passing several good houses, one came to the
Vicarage, which still stands; the senior curate, the Reverend
John Saumarey Winter, lived there.&nbsp; Then there were two good
houses, the further of which was the scene of a very sad
accident&mdash;two children being burned to death in their
beds.&nbsp; The parents were away from home, and the servants,
taking advantage of their absence, gave a party, and forgot all
about the poor little ones until too late.&nbsp; Before St.
Katharine&rsquo;s College was built the ground was used for
allotment gardens; there is so little alteration in the cottages
and houses that follow that no description is needed.&nbsp; Dr.
Robinson, who wrote the History of Tottenham, in 1818, lived in
the house now known as Trafalgar House.&nbsp; There was a large
field opposite, the path through which formed a quick cut to the
bend of the lane.&nbsp; On one side was a quick set <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>hedge, and
bank; in about the middle the path widened into what looked like
a little room, and here, under the shelter of the hedge, poor old
Blind Charlie lived for many years.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Hall, the
Vicar, kindly gave him a mattress to lie on.&nbsp; In the field
adjoining the Churchyard a poor, homeless boy dug a hole, near
the hedge, where he used to sleep, the opening being covered with
a tea-tray.&nbsp; But he was not allowed to stay there long, as
children were afraid of passing.&nbsp; The old bridge crossing
the Moselle was a pretty, narrow one, and on either side stood a
fine oak tree.&nbsp; The trees in the second field were very
beautiful.</p>
<h2>TOTTENHAM PARK.</h2>
<p>The large house covered with ivy which has quite recently been
pulled down, was at one time the Manor House of Pembrokes, and
called The Parsonage, or Rectory House.&nbsp; I remember when it
was called the Moated House.&nbsp; It was built in 1636, and was
surrounded by a moat, over which was a drawbridge.&nbsp; In 1797
Henry Piper Sperling, Esq., purchased the Mansion House of
Pembrokes, with forty-nine acres of land adjoining, and the whole
of the great or rectorial tithes.&nbsp; Soon after he had the
moat filled up.&nbsp; The staircase of this house was very
fine.&nbsp; There used to be a cheerful air of activity about the
old Rectory Farm, with its well-stocked farmyard, and the ducks
and the geese swimming on the pond.&nbsp; The pretty little
plantation by the side of the road, which a little farther on
branched right and left, the road to the right leading to Clay
Hill.&nbsp; <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>At the second bend of the lane, on the left stood a
pretty, long, low house, with a creeper-covered verandah; this
was called Turner&rsquo;s Farm; the yard and outbuildings of this
adjoined those belonging to River House.&nbsp; The New River
Company owned the next farm, and here the road ended in a
beautiful cornfield, across which was a footpath leading to Tile
Kiln-lane.&nbsp; There used to be plenty of water in the river,
but it has been gradually getting less and less.&nbsp; There was
an echo in one of the fields leading to Beet-lane, White
Hart-lane; it was so quiet all round this spot we often amused
ourselves with raising it.&nbsp; A little farther on came
Snakes-lane, leading to Lordship-lane, and Wolves-lane, leading
to Tile Kiln-lane.&nbsp; These lanes were all very lonely, and a
practical joker created a scare by roaming round in the
evening.&nbsp; He was covered with a white sheet, and walked on
high stilts; he was called Spring-heel Jack, but who he was or
where he came from was never discovered; everyone was glad when
he got tired of this form of amusement.&nbsp; I knew one old
inhabitant who was one evening walking along Lordship-lane with
his daughters when they saw a white object in the distance.&nbsp;
The girls immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was
Spring-heel Jack, and were so terrified they screamed so loudly
that they were heard in Wood Green; but it was a false alarm, it
was someone carrying home a basket of washing.&nbsp; Speaking of
the loneliness of the few houses in this lane, Mr. Thomas Fox,
who lived there, made it a practice to go into the <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>garden and
fire off a gun every evening before retiring to rest in order to
let people know he could defend himself against burglars.</p>
<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
<p>In the year 1878 Tottenham High-road was flooded from Bruce
Grove to White Hart-lane.&nbsp; One of the sons of Mr. Gripper,
of the Bell Brewery, had a boat, and rowed up and down, taking
passengers at 6d. each, the money being given to the Tottenham
Hospital.&nbsp; The Tottenham Hospital and Deaconesses&rsquo;
Institution was started by Dr. Laseron in 1868.&nbsp; He worked
indefatigably on its behalf, and people were so willing to help
him that those who were unable to give money gave their
jewellery.&nbsp; It was recognised that a hospital was much
needed; the present building shows how this need has gone on
increasing.</p>
<h2>TRAVELLING</h2>
<p>was not such an easy matter when my mother was a child, and
people did not expect to take the yearly holiday which is now
considered a necessity.&nbsp; Places which now can be reached in
a few hours&rsquo; time were then quite a long journey, and one
had to travel either by post-chaise or stagecoach, which was
pleasant for the outside passengers on a fine summer day, but
anything but comfortable if the weather was cold or wet.&nbsp; It
was very cheerful to hear the guard sounding his horn.&nbsp; For
those who could not afford these conveyances there was the
waggon&mdash;a very slow mode of <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>travelling, this.&nbsp; It was a
huge, clumsy-looking vehicle, drawn by four horses, the waggoner
walking by the side and occasionally sitting on the shafts for
some distance; at night carrying a horn lanthorn.&nbsp; These
waggons were used for moving goods from place to place, and were
very roomy.&nbsp; I knew a lady who, when she was a child,
travelled in this way, under the care of a maid, from
Lincolnshire to Tottenham.&nbsp; My earliest recollection of
travelling is of going to the sea-side in a post-chaise; two
horses were sent on the day before we started.&nbsp; We went
either to Margate or Worthing, and left home at four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; We travelled all day,
changing horses halfway, arriving at our destination that
evening.&nbsp; For those who liked the water there was a boat
called &ldquo;The Margate Hoy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes we varied
our holiday and took apartments at a farmhouse at Finchley, which
was then beautiful country.&nbsp; On those occasions we went in
my father&rsquo;s ph&aelig;ton.&nbsp; It was a very pretty drive
all the way from Tottenham.</p>
<p>My mother remembered a public conveyance called a Shillibeer;
this took its name from the inventor.&nbsp; Later on this was
transformed into the Omnibus, and there was a number of these
conveyances on the road, running to London and back every hour,
the terminus being the &ldquo;Flower Pot,&rdquo;
Bishopsgate-street.&nbsp; Occasionally one was confronted with
the alternative of either walking home or waiting an hour.&nbsp;
For instance, when the May meetings were held, to which the
&ldquo;Friends&rdquo; flocked in large <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>numbers, there was keen competition
for a seat; no woman would have thought of going outside.&nbsp; I
remember once seeing a respectable-looking country woman, taking
her midday meal in the omnibus on her road to London.&nbsp; She
evidently thought she was making a long journey, for opening her
basket she placed a small cloth on her knees; she then produced a
packet of bread and butter, a little parcel of salt, and, putting
an egg in a cup, calmly ate her lunch.&nbsp; On another occasion
a well-known rather eccentric character, having purchased some
peas, shelled them in the omnibus to save time on his return
home.</p>
<p>Tottenham lost its rural character when the railroads were
made.&nbsp; The first of these was the Great Eastern main line,
the Hale and Park Stations being then opened.&nbsp; Park Station
being some distance from the main road Mr. Hall started a service
of omnibusses from &ldquo;The Horse and Groom&rdquo; at Edmonton
to this station.&nbsp; The next was the Midland, and lastly the
Great Eastern suburban line to Enfield.&nbsp; When this was
started the terminus was Bishopsgate-street.</p>
<p>Omnibusses were succeeded by horse trams, these again by steam
trams, having a particularly clumsy appearance, and in a short
time horse trams re-appeared, only to be again altered to
electric trams.</p>
<p>It may not be generally known that once every year there used
to be an official perambulation of the parish; this was called
&ldquo;beating the bounds,&rdquo; and was regarded as an
important occasion to mark the boundaries <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>of the
parish.&nbsp; Of course nothing was allowed to be an obstacle;
where necessary the beaters went through hedges and ditches, and
even through ponds, and at various places one of the boys who
accompanied the procession was well bumped against a wall to
impress the boundary on his mind, so that in after years he could
testify from personal knowledge if any doubt arose.</p>
<p>The first local paper in Tottenham was called &ldquo;Paul
Pry&rdquo;; it was so personal in its remarks, and so much
mischief was made by it, that its life was a brief one.&nbsp; On
the outside was the illustration of a man, with an umbrella under
his arm, and the words, &ldquo;I have just stepped in; I hope I
don&rsquo;t intrude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Weekly Herald&rdquo; was started in 1861.&nbsp; It
had a lot of subsidiary titles, besides that of the North
Middlesex Advertiser which it still bears, but they have since
been discarded.&nbsp; It was started by Mr. E. Cowing under the
management of Mr. Crusha, who took it over in July, 1864.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
